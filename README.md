# DivideAndConquerAlgorithmsPart2
A project in which I was given all the files uploaded but the "DivideAndConquerAlgorithms.java" file had no methods written, so the methods belong to me and the rest to my lecturer.

Part 2 of 3.

Included in DivideAndConquerAlgorithms.java:
iterativeDisplayElements()
recursiveDisplayElements()
smallerMyList()
biggerEqualMyList()
concatenate()
quickSort()
*read the file for further information on these methods*
